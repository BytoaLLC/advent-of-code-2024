    Puzzle Narrative:
    With the Chief Historian still missing, you find yourself in a busy North Pole printing department.
    Here, strict ordering rules govern how new pages for safety manuals must be printed. 
    Each rule "X|Y" says that if an update includes both pages X and Y, X must appear before Y in that update.

    Youâ€™re given:
    - A list of rules defining these page order constraints.
    - A series of updates, each one specifying which pages need printing.

    Task for Part One:
    - Identify which updates already follow all the relevant ordering rules as-is.
    - For each such correctly ordered update, determine its "middle" page and sum these middle pages together.

    Task for Part Two:
    - For the updates that don't follow the rules, reorder them correctly according to the rules using 
      a topological sort (a way to line up pages so all constraints are met).
    - Once corrected, take the middle page from each fixed update and add these up.
    
    You then print both sums:
    - The sum of middle pages from the already-valid updates (Part 1).
    - The sum of middle pages from the newly fixed updates (Part 2).
